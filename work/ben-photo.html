          <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a beautiful and highly functional website for 
            Mr. Britton's photography business. My main goal while building the site was to create a final 
            product that captured his clean, artistic aesthetic and quirky personality while, above all, 
            making sure to showcase his work wherever possible. I wanted to make sure that any potential customers 
            that visit his site are not only wowed by his work, but really get a sense for who he is, as wedding 
            photography can be such a personal experience. I also strived to make the site as clear and as 
            easily-navigable as possible, with links to his portfolio, pricing, social media pages, and 
            most importantly, the contact page all over the site.
            <br/><br/>
            Throughout the process, I worked closely with Mr. Britton to make sure I incorporated all of the elements he 
            desired in his site, including a personal blog, which I built with the help of Sanity Studio. I also created
            a logo for Mr. Britton for branding purposes, as can be seen on the left side of the site navbar.
            <br/><br/>
            The site was built with React.js and styles were implemented with the help of Tailwind CSS, which made it easy to create
            a beautiful, responsive design that looks great on all screen sizes, from the tiniest cell phone to 2XL monitors.
            <br/><br/>
            The site is currently deployed <a href="https://www.benjaminbrittonphotography.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!
