        <h3>Legacy Infrastructure Modernization & Partial Site Redesign</h3>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Developer</p>
        <p><strong>Live Site:</strong> <a href="https://chesapeakeregional.com/" target="_blank">chesapeakeregional.com</a></p>
        <div class="technologies">
          <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Drupal, PHP, Bitbucket Pipelines, Angular, SCSS, Tailwind, Pantheon</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Inherited and completely modernized an extremely outdated enterprise healthcare website that was the only project at Modea without a deployment pipeline. Transformed legacy infrastructure through automation implementation, dependency updates, and comprehensive redesign elements while integrating modern development practices and tools.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="site-background-container">
        <h2>Legacy Challenges & Modernization Strategy</h2>
        
        <h3>Infrastructure Modernization</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Critical Pipeline Development:</strong> When I joined the project, it was extremely old and outdated, most notably being the only project at Modea without a deployment pipeline. All tasks and updates had to be performed manually across environments, creating significant inefficiency and risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Automation Implementation:</strong> Created the project's first-ever Bitbucket pipeline, automating configuration synchronization, composer updates, and deployment processes. This foundational work brought the project into the modern era of development practices.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology Stack Updates</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Angular Modernization:</strong> Updated Angular dependencies in Find a Doctor and Find a Location tools from Angular 9.0 to the current version, addressing critical security vulnerabilities and performance issues that had accumulated over years of technical debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Drupal Upgrade:</strong> Successfully upgraded the site to the current version of Drupal (Drupal 10 at the time), ensuring security compliance and access to modern features while maintaining all existing functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features & Integrations</h2>

        <h3>Homepage Redesign</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Modern User Experience:</strong> Implemented a complete homepage redesign that brought the site into the modern era, making it significantly more usable and easier for patients to navigate to their desired destinations. The new design prioritized user experience and clear information architecture.
        </p>

        <h3>Analytics Integration</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Heap Analytics:</strong> Implemented Heap Analytics to provide comprehensive user behavior tracking and insights, enabling data-driven decision making for future site improvements and user experience optimization.
        </p>

        <h3>AI-Powered Patient Assistance</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Notable AI Assistant:</strong> Integrated Notable AI assistant to help patients navigate site content more effectively, providing intelligent guidance and support for users seeking specific healthcare information or services.
        </p>

        <h3>Automated Review System</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Press Ganey API Integration:</strong> Created a custom Drupal module to query the Press Ganey API and automatically pull in doctor reviews to doctor profile pages. This system runs nightly as a job in Bitbucket Pipelines, automatically updating doctor profiles as new reviews become available, eliminating manual review management.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="site-background-container">
        <h2>Transformation Results</h2>
        <h3>Infrastructure Modernization Impact</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>From Manual to Automated:</strong> Transformed the project from requiring all manual updates and deployments to a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with configuration synchronization and automated testing. This dramatically reduced deployment time and eliminated human error in the release process.
        </p>

        <h3>User Experience Enhancement</h3>
        <p>
          The homepage redesign and AI assistant integration significantly improved the patient experience, making the site much more navigable and helping users quickly find the healthcare information and services they need.
        </p>

        <h3>Technical Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First-ever deployment pipeline implementation for the project</li>
          <li>Angular upgrade from v9 to current version</li>
          <li>Drupal 10 upgrade with full functionality preservation</li>
          <li>Automated configuration synchronization</li>

          <li>Comprehensive homepage redesign</li>
          <li>Responsive design optimization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business Value & Legacy Impact</h3>

          <li>AI-powered patient assistance reducing support burden</li>
          <li>Foundation for future scalable development</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Complete Modernization:</strong> By the time I completed work on the project, it had been completely brought into the modern era. The previously outdated infrastructure was replaced with automated deployment pipelines, current technology versions, and modern development practices. The site's usability was dramatically improved, providing a much better experience for patients seeking healthcare services.
